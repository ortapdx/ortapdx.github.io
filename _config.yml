  Oregon Turkish American Association (ORTA) is a non-profit organization aiming to take its rightful place among the community organizations that are actively reweaving the social fabric of Oregon for a better future. ORTA is dedicated to enriching the lives of the Turkish-American community through educational, recreational, social, and cultural activities in Oregon without supporting any political or religious agenda. We are here to organize events and activities to promote cross cultural exchange of ideas, art, cuisine, traditions. ORTA was founded to create a community and a welcoming environment to anyone who is interested. We strive to extend our support to the Turkish American student body in the area, and partnering with humanitarian organizations in the USA and in Turkey to advance common causes. Come join us! ORTA is your community and we are not complete without you.
